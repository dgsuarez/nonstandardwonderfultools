Non standard yet wonderful UNIX tools
=====================================

This started as a way to keep a bunch of usage examples for non standard UNIX
tools for a lightning talk in a single place, ended up being a short
introduction / tutorial for each of them. You can follow the examples in the
tutorials by cloning this repo, all the files that are used in them are
included here.

Without further ado, here are the tutorials, enjoy!
